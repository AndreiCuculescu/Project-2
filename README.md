# Project-2
PDF to MP3, audio book convertor.
This is my second python project, a PDF convertor to MP3 to create your own audiobooks. 
I created a GUI using tkinter to be more easy to choose the PDF file and then to be able to choose from which page to which page to be converted to audio.
The conversion is made through gTTS(Google text to speech) library and i added an option to select in what languages to convert the PDF.
