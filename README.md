# Project-2
PDF to MP3, audio book convertor.
With this program also made in Python, I have created a GUI in Tkinter and I have configured my personalized audiobooks to listen to while driving. Moreover, I added the choice to select what pages you want to be converted from the file so that the MP3 file contains only what you are interested in and its size is as small as possible. The conversion is made through gTTS(Google text to speech) and is designed to display and select all languages supported by Google.
